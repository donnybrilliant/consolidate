## Overview

The **Consolidate** extension for Visual Studio Code allows you to quickly consolidate all or selected files from your workspace into a single text file. This is particularly useful for sharing project files in a single document, reviewing multiple files at once, or even preparing files for use in AI tools like GPT, where referencing multiple files in a web prompt can be challenging.

## Features

- **Consolidate All Files**: Combines the contents of all files in your workspace into a single output file, respecting `.gitignore` and hidden files.
- **Consolidate Selected Files**: Right-click on selected files or folders in the explorer or open tabs to combine their contents into a single output file.
- **First-Run Configuration**: Decide whether to save the consolidated content to a file, open it in a new tab, or copy it to the clipboard.

## Usage

### 1. First-Run Configuration

When you run the Consolidate extension for the first time, you will be prompted to configure how you want the extension to behave. You can select from the following options:

- **Create File:** Consolidate files into a new output file.
- **Open in New Tab:** Open the consolidated content in a new editor tab.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Copy the consolidated content to your clipboard.

Once youâ€™ve configured these settings, they will persist for future use. On subsequent runs, the extension will use these saved preferences.

### 2. Consolidate All Files

1. Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux).
2. Type `Consolidate Files` and press `Enter`.
3. Depending on your configuration:
   - **If "Create File" is selected**, you will be prompted to enter a file name for the output (e.g., `consolidated_output.txt`).
   - **If "Open in New Tab" is selected**, the content will open in a new editor tab without saving to a file.
   - **If "Copy to Clipboard" is selected**, the consolidated content will be copied directly to your clipboard.
4. The contents of all non-hidden, non-ignored files will be consolidated.

Alternatively, right-click in the Explorer panel, with no files selected and choose Consolidate All Files to consolidate all files in your workspace into a single text file.

### 3. Consolidate Selected Files

1. Select the files or folders in the explorer or open tabs that you want to consolidate.
2. Right-click and choose `Consolidate Selected Files`.
3. Depending on your configuration:
   - **If "Create File" is selected**, you will be prompted to enter a file name for the output (e.g., `consolidated_selected_output.txt`).
   - **If "Open in New Tab" is selected**, the selected files' content will open in a new editor tab.
   - **If "Copy to Clipboard" is selected**, the consolidated content will be copied directly to your clipboard.
4. The contents of the selected files will be consolidated into the specified file.

## Installation

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view (`Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows/Linux).
3. Search for `Consolidate Files`.
4. Click `Install`.

## Configuration

### First-Run Configuration

Upon running the extension for the first time, you will be prompted to select default behaviors for how consolidated content should be handled (create a file, copy to clipboard, open new tab).

You can change how the extension handles consolidated content at any time:

1. Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`).
2. Type `Consolidate: Configure Settings`.
3. Select your new preferred options.
